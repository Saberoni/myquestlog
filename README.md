# My Resume and Blog

> Who want's to go on a journey when instead we can go on a quest?

I started this page initially as a Resume and because I wanted to give Hugo a try. I'll also use it as a place to keep notes and maybe post some guides, too many times I've done something interesting at work, or ran into a problem, found the solution and never actually noted it down only to run into it a again months/years later.

This site is hosted and built with CloudFlare Pages. 

Pages will automatically build and publish preview pages on pull requests, I have updated the deployment settings so it doesn't build on chore and doc branchs.
