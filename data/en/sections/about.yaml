# a summary about you
summary: |
  I am an experienced DevOps Engineer with over 6 years working in the cloud. Primarily AWS focused, 
  but have also used a a lot of Azure and a small amount of GCP.
  I enjoy containerization and specifically enjoy working with Kubernetes.
  I believe in Infrastructure As Code rather than click-ops.
  I am always eager to learn more, and enjoy problem solving. I value teamwork and collaboration over working alone, whilst 
  also being self directed and willing to get stuck into the tasks at hand. 
  I primarily work in Python and bash, but have experience with Powershell when having to deal with Windows systems.
